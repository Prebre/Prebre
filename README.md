### Good morrow, fellow GitHub'er! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ida, and I am a Front End Development student. I work as a teacher as well, but am looking into working with web/ux development/design in the future. I am married and have two children, enjoy games of different kinds, love music and creativity, and will gladly consume fantasy and sci-fi media if I can!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a portfolio assignment for my study programme.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front End Development in general, but I personally am more focused on learning to master JavaScript right now, as this is what I'm having the most trouble understanding in my studies so far.
